# CSCI-142
Lab Assignments from RIT CSCI-142, an OOP Intensive Course (Java)


This course delves into data structure and design with an object-oriented perspective. 
Topics include tree and graph structures, nested data structures, objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, 
object-oriented collection class libraries for abstract data types (e.g. maps) and static vs. dynamic data types. 
Input and output streams, graphical user interfaces, and exception handling are also covered.

Concepts of object-oriented design are a large part of the course. Software qualities related to object orientation,
namely cohesion, minimal coupling, modifiability, and extensibility, are introduced in this course, as well as some 
object-oriented design patterns. The course also introduces use of a modern integrated software development environment (IDE).
