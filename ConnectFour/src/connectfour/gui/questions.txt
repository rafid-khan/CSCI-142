CSCI-142 Lab 7: Connect Four

Answer each of the following questions regarding the design of this application.

1. In terms of MVC, which part does ConnectFourBoard represent?
- In terms of MVC, ConnectFourBoard represents the Model. This means that it gets and
  manipulates data, but is not aware of the view. Since it's the model, it will also
  communicate with the controller.

2. In terms of MVC, which *parts* do ConnectFourGUI and ConnectFourPTUI represent?
- In terms of MVC, ConnectFourGUI represents the View, which means it is responsible for
  what the user sees when they interact with the application. Like the Model, it also
  communicates with the controller.

- ConnectFourPTUI represents the Controller. This means that it gets data from the
  Model, and passes this data to the View. It also handles exceptions.

3. What interface/method must ConnectFourGUI implement?
- Since ConnectFourGUI represents the View, it must build an interface exactly the way
  it would appear to the user. This includes things such as the Stage, Scene, Layout, and
  all associated objects.

4. What method in ConnectFourBoard is used to call into ConnectFourGUI when the board changes?
- getContents() and makeMove() in ConnectFourBoard is used to call into ConnectFourGUI when the
  board changes.
